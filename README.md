# DeOldify Video Colorizer

*Bring black-and-white videos back to life with DeOldify — right in Google Colab!*

This notebook is an updated and streamlined version of the original DeOldify video colorization Colab notebook ([archived](https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify)).

✅ Successfully tested in November 2025.

Simply click the badge below to open the notebook in Google Colab (you’ll need a Google account).

It will automatically generate a colorized version of the sample video:
🎞️ [Lee De Forest in his laboratory (1939)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyamahat/DeOldify_Video_Colorizer/refs/heads/main/Lee_De_Forest_(1939).mp4)

Once you have successfully colorized this sample video, you can try with other vintage videos (for example, by providing a link to a short YouTube video).
